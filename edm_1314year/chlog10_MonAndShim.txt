CHANGELOG
---------

Old VI: C:\EDM\2013LabviewVIs\2013-02FieldMonitoringAndShimmingv_09
New VI: C:\EDM\2013LabviewVIs\2013-02FieldMonitoringAndShimmingv_10

* Created new 1Axis waveform graph (1AxisB_mG WDT) with WDT input to match 
  3Axis graphs.
* Set 1Axis chart history length at 10000 waveforms to match 3Axis graphs.
* Hid old graph (1AxisB_mG DBL). The graph is still generated since output is
  collected from it to write to the binary file. The DBL was added to the name.
* Changed sub VI
  (MODIFIED 34401A Average and Standard Deviation Reading2013-02.vi) to accept
  new input (Loop interval (ms)) used as the wait time between iterations of 
  the main reading loop.
* Set 1Axis interval between samples (ms) to 250, calculated to match
  sampling rate <4> for the 3Axis probes. Will match up in v11.
* Added a timestamp wired to t0 for WDT graph.
* Grouped 1Axis controls on Setup tab.
* Moved entire 1Axis reading loop inside the sequence structure alongside the
  3Axis readings, such that both start after the first dialog box. This way,
  the start times are synchronized to within ~300 ms.
* Added button to clear out all charts. Though this cannot happen exactly
  simultaneously since the different charts are written in different loops,
  after letting the button go, the charts should be synced to within 1 s.
* Added a bunch of comments for ambiguous chunks of code in v9.

Potential todo:

* Remove 1AxisB_mG DBL completely and retrive data for binary write from WDT
  chart.
* Deal with error out from 34401A sub VI.
* Synchronize 1Axis and 3Axis sampling rates automatically.
* Put 1Axis and 3Axis readings in same loop and same waveform chart? This
  would eliminate the need for the "Clear All Charts" button.
* Create clean stopping method to minimize memory issues.
