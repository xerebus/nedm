CHANGELOG
---------

Old VI: C:\EDM\2013LabviewVIs\2013-02FieldMonitoringAndShimmingv_10
New VI: C:\EDM\2013LabviewVIs\2013-02FieldMonitoringAndShimmingv_11

* Synchronized 1Axis and 3Axis sampling rates automatically.
* Put 1Axis and 3Axis loops in the same case structure.
* Reduced Interval between samples (ms) to just an indicator - variable
  value is not read afterwards.

Potential todo:

* Remove 1AxisB_mG DBL completely and retrive data for binary write from WDT
  chart.
* Deal with error out from 34401A sub VI.
* Put 1Axis and 3Axis readings in same loop and same waveform chart? This
  would eliminate the need for the "Clear All Charts" button.
* Create clean stopping method to minimize memory issues.
